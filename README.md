# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Deep-Learning-Model
I have used deep learning models like RNN GRU LSTM BiLSTM
This question uses following dataset of Urdu sentiment analysis. The class labels are P(positive)
and N (Negative)

Implement following sequence based deep learning models for the same task of sentiment
analysis. Perform binary text classification.
RNN
GRU
LSTM
BiLSTM
You can implement these models in Keras or Pytorch. Split the data into train and test set. Use
75% for training and 25% for testing.
For each of these models, try following hyper parameters and report the best results with
parameter values.
Number of layers = 2 or 3.
Dropout rate, 0.3 or 0.7
So you will have 2 *2 = 4 different sets of parameters.
Calculate accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-score for all classifiers and report the results in table.
Also report parameter values which were used to get the results.
